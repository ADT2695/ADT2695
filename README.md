- 👋 Hi, I’m @ADT2695, and I'm very new here. I would love to get familar with this website and each and every one of you, especially who I will eventually collaborate with.
- 👀 I’m interested in sports, history, physiology, zoology, psychology, etymology, anthropology, linguistics, geography etc; AND technical, computer-related topics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program, code through the processes of data analytics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects related to the above, for the purpose of learning more than I currently already understand. I truly do have a passion for learning, so, by all means teach me something new that I can utilize!
- 📫 How to reach me: Adt2695@hotmail.com (I do not really use 'Social Media' often enough for it to be considered a reliable method of contact).
